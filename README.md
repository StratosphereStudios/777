**Q: What is the black console window that appears when I start the aircraft?**

A: Don't close it. It helps the developers find bugs and fix them. If you close this window, X-Plane will crash. Along with the log.txt, this is one of the primary tools for investigating issues.

**Q: How do I start the aircraft?**

A: As of now, you can't start the plane from cold and dark becasue we did not add systems yet. For now, in the X-Plane menu, set the engines on. When systems are added, [you should follow the checklists and manuals found here.](https://github.com/StratosphereStudios/777/tree/main/Documentation)
