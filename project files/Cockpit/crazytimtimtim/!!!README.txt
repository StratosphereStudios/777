The files in this folder are models by Nathroxer that I (crazytimtimtim) am working on.

FOR NATHROXER: YOU NEED THE LATEST XTLUA CODE FROM GITHUB FOR THESE TO WORK. I noticed a few issues with the alignment of knobs on the MCP, of which I fixed 1. MCP buttons animated but doesn't work because I didn't use empties. Collections edited: cockpit (manips, displays added and separated), cockpit_glass (added new glass, fixed old glass), mcp (adjusted airspeed knob, tried to animate), cockpit_main (moved EFB to "bruh"), center_ped_1 (fixed flap handle animation), "bruh" (new collection, take a look at it). You need to fix the glareshield as it is positioned incorrectly.

Also I think I accidentally created a bunch of random materials, you can delete those.

I will keep working on manips and uploading them to github, so remember to check back. This is not final.
